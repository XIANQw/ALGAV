## Introduction
In this project i would like to resolve some convex hull problems, such as minimum covering circle, the smallest covering polygon and the smallest covering rectangle.

## Algorithm
- Minimum covering circle : Ritter algorithm
- Minimum covering polygon : Jarvis algorithm
- Minimum covering rectangle : Toussaint algorithm

## Guide
 - Compilation
```
  make
```

- Execution
```
  make run
```
- Clean porject
```
make clean
```
