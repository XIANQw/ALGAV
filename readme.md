# Convex Hull Problem

In this project i would like to resolve some convex hull problems, such as minimum covering circle, the smallest covering polygon and the smallest covering rectangle.

## Algorithm
 - Minimum covering circle : Approximation algorithm
 - Minimum covering polygon : Jarvis algorithm
 - Minimum covering rectangle : Toussaint algorithm
